# rLastManStanding
Minecraft Spigot plugin. Add "Last Man Standing" minigames to your server. Easy to use, and made to be easly scheduable.

# How to build
It's a gradle project so building should be as easy as opening the project with an IDE like Intellij or Eclipse. The IDE should handle downloading the dependecies. That said it does depend on Vault and PlaceholdersAPI. It's planned to make those softdepend.
